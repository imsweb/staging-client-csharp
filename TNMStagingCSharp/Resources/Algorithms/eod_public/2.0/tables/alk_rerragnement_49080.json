  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Physician statement of ALK rearrangement for non-small cell carcinoma can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 2:** ALK may be recorded for all histologies and stages; however, it is primarily performed for advanced non-small cell carcinomas. If information is not available, code 9. \n\n**Note 3:** The absence or presence of ALK protein expression determines if the tumor will respond to treatment with a targeted inhibitor. ALK protein expression predicts the ALK rearrangement gene, which are more likely to respond to the targeted inhibitor treatment. The most common ALK rearrangements are \n * EML4-ALK\n * KIF5B-ALK\n * TFG-ALK\n * KLC1-ALK\n\n**Note 4:** If ALK Rearrangement is positive and there is no mention of the specific rearrangement, code 4.\n\n**Note 5:** If neoadjuvant therapy is given, record the assay from tumor specimens prior to neoadjuvant therapy.\n * If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no ALK results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens\n\n**Note 6:** Code 9 when\n * Insufficient amount of tissue available to perform test\n * Test done and documented to be equivocal\n * No microscopic confirmation of tumor \n * ALK Rearrangement not ordered or not done, or unknown if ordered or done",
